This project provides an oscillator library and a Windows ImGui implementation that uses the library. The GUI allows the user to customize a collection of oscillators, render the output to an audio device, and see the wave output in a live graph. Each oscillator may be a sine, square, saw, or triangle wave whose volume, pan, and frequency are adjustable. The ultimate goal of this project is to connect this oscillator collection to visual input for generative music. It could also work as a general software synthesizer.

The program has two threads: the GUI (non-realtime) thread, and the realtime thread. The realtime thread, managed by the `portaudio` library, runs with highest possible priority. That thread calls the audio callback, whose responsibility it is to write the next set of samples to the audio buffer passed to the audio device, at some (possibly variable) interval. Since the GUI must change settings of the oscillators, and the realtime thread must read the settings of the oscillators, a goal of the architecture is to avoid data races. To this end, the threads communicate via events passed via lock-free queues. The GUI thread enqueues requests onto a single-producer single-consumer queue provided by the `farbot` library. The realtime thread reacts to those requests and enqueues responses on a separate queue that returns to the GUI thread. In this way, the GUI stays updated with the latest settings of the oscillators, without needing to read or write their settings directly. In optimized builds, with a sufficiently low audio callback interval, the "event lag" between the GUI thread enqueueing an event and the realtime thread reacting to it is very low so as to be unnoticeable.

The program provides the ability to log and save the audio session to a file. Though this requires some allocation on the realtime thread (a bad idea), it is useful when debugging, and does not cause discontinuities even on my relatively underpowered laptop (i5-8250U @ 1.6GHz). Each oscillator automatically fades between changes of volume, pan, and frequency so no discontinuities arise while modifying settings. The program has the ability to graph the output live by logging the samples for both L and R channels with `implot`.
